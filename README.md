# ff-enhancer
FF-Enhancer (ALPHA) is a chrome extension for extending the filtering options for FF.net. 
It allows you to specifiy more specific filters and filter by tags to include/exclude.  
  It is designed to be customizable based on the user's needs, but as this is a work in progress, so features may be added or removed.  

### Features:
- Better filtering based on Story properties:
  - Filter based on words, chapters, reviews, favourites, follows, publish date and update date
    For example you can filter to show only stories that have 20000 to 50000 words and more than 10 chapters and published between Apr 30 2010 and Sep 4 2017.
- Filter by tags:
  - Remove stories that contain certain words in the story description. For example you can remove all stories with "ham" in its description.
  - Show only stories that have certain words in the description. E.g. show only stories with "pizza" in the description.
  - A mixture of the above!
  - You can also filter in/out various ship names (specified by "Char1/Char2") - more info about this to be added later.

### Planned features / improvements:
